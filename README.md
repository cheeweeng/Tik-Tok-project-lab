# TikTok Claims Classification Project
Overview  
This project is part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate program. The scenario is based on a fictional workplace case study at TikTok, where the goal is to build a predictive model that can classify user-submitted video content as either containing a claim or an opinion. This classification helps TikTok moderators efficiently prioritize user reports and manage the growing volume of flagged content.

# Tik-Tok-project-lab
Develop a structured and clean dataframe from the TikTok dataset to prepare for further exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.
